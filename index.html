    Good morning, this is Wayne!
    I love game development and I have several projects I worked on in my free time.
    In this portfolio I am going to talk about them.
            
    Thank you for viewing!

    This is a card game about lobsters! We have been working on this 
    project for a whole month and I am working on the battle system. 
    I have never maken digital card games before, so I enjoy programming 
    this game.

    The first thing I tried to implement is dragging the card to floor. 
    I use raycast to check what player touches when they press down and 
    release mouse, so I can know if they are clicking a card and if they 
    are dragging it to a spot on the floor. Later there are more things 
    to test, like commanding lobsters to attack/denfense and choosing 
    targets/materials. I add variables to store the current states of 
    the game and test different stuffs when player press down/release 
    mouse button at different states.

    It is a 2D platformer game about a dog. I joined this project in 
    the middle, so I spent many time reading and understanding existing 
    code when I wanted to program something related to an existed system.
    
    Even though it is a 2D platformer game, the mechanic is already 
    implemented when I joined the team. I work on things like save system, 
    dialogue system and cutscene. I also made the UI to create and select
    save file at Main Menu. For the dialogue system, I stored the dialogue 
    information in json files to make it easier for localization if we want
    to do that in the future. My teammates are skillful at their fields, so I 
    have a good feeling about this project.

    Lead Programmer on a 5-member team</b>

    Most members in my team have made too many 2d games, so we end up 
    making a 3d game for the global game jam. The theme was a tough one, 
    "What does home make you feel". Our designer was also a writer, so we 
    ended up making this narrative game.

    My other programmers were concentrating on tech art, so I programmed a 
    bunch of stuffs including player movement, player camera, cutscenes, 
    picking up items, playing voice, displaying subtitles..... I kinda got
    interested in shader after this game jam seeing my teammates doing it
    and I plan to learn it too when I have time.
