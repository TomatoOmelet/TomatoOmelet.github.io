    <b>Riley's adventures in Terribleland                                          2018 Summer
    Solo project</b>
    
    It's a birthday present I made for my awesome fantastic wonderful friend. 
    I came up with an idea that the player becomes an infant in another world, 
    and need to grow up to 21 years old to come back. I start to add relevant 
    stuff around this idea, finally it became something like this.
    
    Map tiles will change randomly after player pass them. Different things 
    will happen when players step on different tiles. Question mark tile is 
    the most common one and will trigger a random event. There is also a 
    shop where players can buy items with their money.

    Programmer on a 6-member team</b>
    
    A 2d game finished at a game jam in Fall 2018. My teammates are 
    wonderful and I had a great time working with them.
        
    In this project I worked on the planets which attract player to 
    rotate around them. One teammate added a circle showing the orbit 
    to make it look greater. The enemy who will shoot at players and 
    the camera which can follow player and zoom in/out are also 
    interesting to program. I tried some new things like particle 
    system in this game jam. Our artist created art very fast so I 
    also made a bunch of animation controllers.

    Solo project</b>
    
    A simple 2D infinite flyer game I made during summer vacation. 
    It was my first time to try making a phone game, and I found 
    that was not difficult with Unity.
    
    Players control the character to fly and shoot in a randomly 
    generated map. The game records players' hightest score and 
    their setting for volumn and language.

    <b>Painting Demo                                                 2018 Summer
    Self Practice</b>
    
    This is a practice I did during the summer. I tried to make a 
    painting tool in Unity.
    
    At first I created objects at the mouse position but it made 
    eraser difficult to program. Then I separated the board to 
    different pixel blocks and used array to store the information. 
    I put objects at the position of pixels but when there are too 
    many objects the fps became very low. In the end I put a 
    transparent picture on the board and called Unity's function 
    to modify the pixel of the picture.

    Though it is still buggy when player draw fast, trying to do 
    new things is interesting.
