    It is a 2D platformer game about a dog. I joined this project in 
    the middle, so I spent much time reading and understanding existing 
    code when I need to touch or use them.

    Although it is a 2D platformer game, the mechanic is already 
    implemented when I joined the team. I worked on things like the save 
    system, dialogue system and cutscenes. I also made the UI to create and 
    select save file at Main Menu. For the dialogue system, I serialized text
    information to json files to make it easier for localization if we want
    to do that in the future. I also modified the timeline in Unity to create 
    dialogue tracks and made the cutscenes for this game. My teammates 
    are skillful at their fields, and I had a good experience working on this project.

    This is a card game about lobsters! We have been working on this 
    project for a whole month and I am working on the battle system. 
    I have never maken digital card games before, so I enjoy programming 
    this game.

    The first thing I tried to implement is dragging the card to floor. 
    I used raycast to check what player touches when they press down and 
    release mouse, so I can know if they are clicking a card and if they 
    are dragging it to a spot on the floor. Later there are more things 
    to check, like commanding lobsters to attack/denfense and choosing 
    targets/materials. I add variables to store the current states of 
    the game and test different stuffs when player press down/release 
    mouse button at different states.

    Most members in my team have made too many 2d games, so we end up 
    making a 3d game for the global game jam. The theme was a tough one, 
    "What does home make you feel". Our designer was also a writer, so we 
    ended up making this narrative game.

    Other programmers were concentrating on tech art, so I programmed a 
    bunch of stuffs including player movement, player camera, cutscenes, 
    picking up items, playing voice, displaying subtitles..... I kinda got
    interested in shader after this game jam seeing my teammates doing it
    and I plan to learn it too when I have time.
